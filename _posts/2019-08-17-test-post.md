Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.


Test LaTeX:

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$



Test python

{% highlight py %}
for i,v in enumerate(testSet):
  count = count+v*2*i

print("Training Set Score: {:.2f}".format(lasso00001.score(X_train, y_train)))
{% endhighlight %}


<pre><code class="css">#container {
    float: left;
    margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>
