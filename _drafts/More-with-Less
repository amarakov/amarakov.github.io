Thiel: technology is finding a way to do more with Needless


More _what_ with less _what_?

Seems like a lot of tech is doing more with more. More CPU cycles, more kWhr burned, more cores, more transistors, etc

We need to find a way to keep giving MORE? More what? Energy.

Energy --> Computation --> Prediction --> Prototype --> products

We need more energy density (Fission, fusion?), we need more computation (Quantum?) to answer the increasingly complex questions that we are facing in all fields
