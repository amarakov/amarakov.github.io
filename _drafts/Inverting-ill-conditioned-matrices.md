title: Ill-Conditioned Matrices
description: summary of a paper I found for finding the inverse of a nearly singular matrix
---

Notes:
- you can't tell the difference between a well behaved matrix and a poorly behaved (bastard) matrix
- simple solution: add smol perturbation to matrix, then invert
