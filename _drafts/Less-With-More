'knowledge' is being 'gained', but by whom and to what end?

Main Idea: the only way to know what knowledge is actually useful and worth keeping is to try to build something from it. Something real, not theoretical edifices that work in some toy environment. Only real development of real capabilities, products, software, etc can tell you what building blocks you are missing.
